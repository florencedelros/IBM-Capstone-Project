    "In order to segment and explore the neighborhoods, we can extract the data of New York City neighborhoods from the [NYU Spatial Data Repository](https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572). Here, we can obtain:\n",

    "#### Venues and Places of Interest:\n",
    "One important decision variable of people would be the places of interest around the neighborhood. This can be obtained from the FourSquare API. For each neighborhood, we have chosen a radius of 500 meter. We will be obtaining:\n",

Thus, I have retrieved the NYPD complaints dataset from [NYC OpenData](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Crime-Map-/5jvd-shfj). This will give us a basic overview of crimes in boroughs in overall. We do not require all columns from this dataset as well, and thus, will also be cleaned. We will only need:\n",
