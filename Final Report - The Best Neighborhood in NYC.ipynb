There is a plethora of decision variables one has to consider when choosing the perfect neighborhood. It could be the place interests, food locations, crime rates, housing prices etc. \n\nThe purpose of this report is to allow people to make smarter and more informed decisions when selecting the neighborhood that is best fit with their interests, budgets and concerns.\n\nWith access to databases available on the internet, we are able to extract information relevant to our places of interest. In this project, we will be making use of database website such as Foursquare and other relevant OpenData websites for the information we need. In the end of this report, we should be able to confidently recommend the best neighborhoods in New York City.\n\n"

The main purpose of this project is to suggest the best neighborhoods in the city for someone shifting to this state.\n"

Here, we can obtain:\n\n1. Borough\n2. Neighborhood\n3. Latitude\n4. Longitude\n\n#### 2.2 Venues and Places of Interest:\nOne important decision variable of people would be the places of interest around the neighborhood. This can be obtained from the FourSquare API. For each neighborhood, we have chosen a radius of 500 meter. We will be obtaining:\n\n1. Neighborhood\n2. Neighborhood Latitude\n3. Neighborhood Longitude\n4. Venue\n5. Venue Latitude\n6. Venue Longitude\n7. Venue Category\n\n#### 2.3 Subsidized Housing Prices:\nThe prices of properties is a major factor in one's decision in moving into a neighborhood. Thus, I extracted this data from [CoreData.nyc](http://app.coredata.nyc/?mlb=true&ntii=&ntr=&mz=14&vtl=https%3A%2F%2Fthefurmancenter.carto.com%2Fu%2Fnyufc%2Fapi%2Fv2%2Fviz%2F98d1f16e-95fd-4e52-a2b1-b7abaf634828%2Fviz.json&mln=false&mlp=true&mlat=40.718&ptsb=&nty=&mb=roadmap&pf=%7B%7D&md=table&mlv=false&mlng=-73.996&btl=Borough&atp=properties) to facilitate in our analysis. We do not require all columns from this dataset. Thus, this will be cleaned and we will only be obtaining:\n\n1. boro_name\n2. accessed_value\n3. res_unit\n\n#### 2.4 Crime Data:\nAnother major deciding factor for many residents are crimes rates within the area. Thus, I have retrieved the NYPD complaints dataset from [NYC OpenData](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Crime-Map-/5jvd-shfj). This is a very large dataset, consisting of 108058 rows, thus we reduced this to be able to work with the data easier. \n\nThis will give us a basic overview of crimes in boroughs in overall. We do not require all columns from this dataset as well, and thus, will also be cleaned. We will only need:\n\n1. BORO_NM\n2. Latitude\n3. Longitude"
